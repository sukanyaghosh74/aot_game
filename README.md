# The Tall Wall Falls — VR Combat Experience

> *A physics‑driven VR action experience inspired by high‑mobility combat and vertical traversal.*

---

## Overview

**The Tall Wall Falls** is a fast‑paced virtual reality combat game built in **Unity** that focuses on momentum, movement mastery, and immersive first‑person action. Players traverse large environments using grappling mechanics while defending a fortified wall against overwhelming threats.

Originally developed as a rapid‑iteration project, this repository contains the **complete Unity project**, including gameplay systems, VR configuration, visual effects, and assets required to explore or extend the experience.

This project serves both as:

* A playable VR prototype
* A learning resource for Unity + VR development
* A reference implementation for physics‑based traversal systems

---

## Key Features

* ⚙️ **Physics‑Based Movement** — Momentum‑driven grappling and aerial traversal
* 🕶️ **VR‑First Design** — Built for immersive head‑mounted display interaction
* 🧠 **Skill‑Focused Gameplay** — Movement mastery directly affects combat efficiency
* 🎮 **Unity XR Integration** — Configured for OpenVR environments
* ✨ **Visual Effects System** — Speed lines, environmental feedback, and UI overlays
